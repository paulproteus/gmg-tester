# This is a script that is run every time you call "vagrant-spk dev".
# It is intended to do platform-and-repository-specific build steps.  You
# might customize it to do any of the following, or more:
# - for Python, prepare a virtualenv and pip install -r requirements.txt
# - for PHP, call composer to retrieve additional packages
# - for JS/CSS/SASS/LESS, compile, minify, or otherwise do asset pipeline work.
# This particular script does nothing at present, but you should adapt it
# sensibly for your package.
